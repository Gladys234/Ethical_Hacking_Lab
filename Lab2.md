Some Major Cyber Attacks are;
1) WannaCry Ransomware Attack (Unauthorized): The WannaCry attack was unauthorized because it exploited a Windows vulnerability without permission.
Hackers encrypted users’ files and demanded ransom payments in Bitcoin, disrupting global systems.
It was unethical as it caused widespread harm, data loss, and financial damage to innocent users and organizations.

2) Yahoo Data Breach (Unauthorized): The Yahoo breach was unauthorized, involving illegal access to billions of user accounts.
Hackers stole personal data including emails, passwords, and phone numbers without consent.
This act was unethical because it violated user privacy, trust, and data protection rights.

3) The Stuxnet operation was authorized because it was reportedly carried out by the U.S. and Israeli governments with official approval. 
It was part of a covert mission to hinder Iran’s nuclear weapons program.
It was sanctioned at the state level, meaning the actions were permitted under government orders rather than conducted by independent hackers.


Reports On The Ethical and Legal Implications; 
** Ethical Implications: Unauthorized attacks like WannaCry and Yahoo breaches are unethical because they deliberately harm users, disrupt operations, and violate confidentiality.
They exploit weaknesses for personal or political gain, undermining digital trust. Conversely, ethical hacking such as in Operation Aurora promotes integrity, responsibility.
It also provides public safety by identifying vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them.

** Legal Implications: Unauthorized hacking breaches national and international laws, including the Computer Misuse Act, CFAA (Computer Fraud and Abuse Act), and GDPR.
Offenders face criminal charges, heavy fines, and imprisonment.
Authorized ethical hacking operates under written consent and legal contracts, ensuring compliance with laws and protecting both the organization and the security professionals involved.
